This work will separate the data according to the label name in one column by taking care of the merged cell in the id column. For example in column 29, levels are mentioned. Different levels have different sheets in the Excel file. This code will run through the id column which is 2 and copy the entire row and write on the label-wise sheet. One ID may have merged into multiple rows and may have different levels under the same ID. Those are marked as split and can be found on the split sheet.

To run this code:
1. Please keep the file in the same directory where the Python file located
2. change the code according the to file name and required data search. This is just a basic work.
3. run Python3 file.py [Please Make sure you close the excel file that is you are trying to update]
