This work will separate the data according to the label name in one column by taking care of the merged cell in the id column. For example in column 29, levels are mentioned. Different levels have different sheets in the Excel file. This code will run through the id column which is 2 and copy the entire row and write on the label-wise sheet. One ID may have merged into multiple rows and may have different levels under the same ID. Those are marked as split and can be found on the split sheet.
